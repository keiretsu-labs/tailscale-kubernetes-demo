      prompt: Examine the person in these images from the {camera} security camera
        at the front door. What are they doing, and how might their actions suggest
        their purpose (e.g., delivering something, approaching, leaving)? If they
        are carrying or interacting with a package, include details about its source
        or destination. For additional context, this camera is placed on our front
        porch, looking at the door and walkway up to the house from the street. This
        is the second main entrance for the house and commonly used for mail, deliveries,
        and guests. The door in the camera view leads into our living room.
