# GitOps Repository
Welcome to the GitOps repository for managing the `k8s-robbinsdale` Kubernetes cluster. This repository leverages [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for continuous delivery, [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) for configuration management, and [Helm](https://helm.sh/) for deploying applications. The repository defines the desired state of various applications and infrastructure components within the cluster, ensuring consistency and ease of management.

## Overview
This repository serves as the single source of truth for the `k8s-robbinsdale` Kubernetes cluster configurations. By following GitOps principles, any changes committed to this repository are automatically synchronized to the cluster, ensuring that the actual state matches the desired state defined here.
